### Utilizes Pytorch & hugging Face's Transformers library, pretrained on 'distilbert-base-uncased'

This project primarily focuses on enhancing the digitization of sustainability data of 2050 Materials, a tech company providing a digital library of eco-friendly building materials. The project aims to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enhance the search capabilities on the platform using by natural language. Specifically, natural language processing will enable multiparameter filtering giving architects a powerful tool. This would facilitate the transition to a more sustainable and responsible building industry.

We specifically chose to utilize pre-trained models, notably BERT, due to its high accuracy. However, given BERT's high computational demand, we opted for the more efficient DistilBERT, which provides near-equivalent performance. The model operates in two primary stages: Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Category Matching. The initial stage employs NER, an NLP task for locating and categorizing named entities into defined groups such as product types, material types, and building applications, among others. For initial testing, we used a categorically organized temporary dataset, including parameters like product type and material type, which were extracted from the 2050 Materials' digital library. To simulate potential user inputs, we created template queries and corresponding labels with a custom Python script to aid in training our NER model. The second stage, Category Matching, employs NLU to match the identified entities from the NER stage to a predefined list of categories. This is accomplished by training the model on these categories and fine-tuning it to understand and mimic the search behavior of users. The integration of NER and Category Matching creates a multi-filtering system capable of handling complex queries, making the model both versatile and efficient.

Initially, DistilBERT tokenizes queries for processing by the fine-tuned Named Entity Recognition (NER) model. The NER identifies and categorizes query components, such as product types, material types, and building applications. These categorized entities are then managed by our Category Matching models, each tailored to a specific search parameter. After undergoing tokenization, each entity is compared with database items for similarity, and items with the highest scores are retrieved. The model's result set reflects its capability to process complex queries, marking a significant contribution to sustainable construction. Future considerations will address model enhancements for increased versatility and efficiency.
